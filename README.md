# DSPS_JFalla

My name is Jose Falla (he/him) and I'm a third year Physics PhD student at the University of Delaware. I'm taking PHYS661 because I am getting a master's degree (while still getting my PhD)--I need 6 more credits--and this class was the most appealing out of all the classes being offered this semester by the Physics Department (the other 3 credits are from a Math class, in case you were wondering). In this class, I hope to understand machine learning beyond a "black box" approach, which is how I currently use it for research. I think I'm an OK coder.
